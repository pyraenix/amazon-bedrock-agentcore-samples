## 📚 Educational vs Production Examples

### Educational Examples (Safe for Learning)

These examples use safe test endpoints and are designed for learning:

| Use Case | Educational URL | Purpose |
|----------|----------------|---------|
| Basic Web Scraping | `https://httpbin.org/html` | Learn content extraction |
| Form Testing | `https://httpbin.org/forms/post` | Practice form automation |
| JSON Data | `https://httpbin.org/json` | Handle structured data |
| Generic Examples | `https://example.com` | Universal placeholder |
| E-commerce Demo | `https://demo.opencart.com/` | Safe e-commerce testing |
| CAPTCHA Demo | `https://www.google.com/recaptcha/api2/demo` | CAPTCHA detection learning |

### Production Examples (Require Compliance)

For real-world implementations, see [Real-World Implementations Guide](REAL_WORLD_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md):

| Use Case | Approach | Compliance Required |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| News Monitoring | Use news APIs (NewsAPI, RSS feeds) | ✅ API ToS compliance |
| E-commerce Pricing | Use official APIs (Amazon Product API) | ✅ Commercial licensing |
| Job Listings | Use job board APIs (Indeed API, LinkedIn) | ✅ Data usage agreements |
| Social Media | Use platform APIs (Twitter API, Facebook Graph) | ✅ Platform developer terms |
| Real Estate | Use MLS APIs or licensed data providers | ✅ MLS licensing requirements |

## 🚦 Implementation Decision Tree

```
Are you learning web automation concepts?
├─ YES → Use educational examples with test endpoints
└─ NO → Are you building for production?
    ├─ YES → Check compliance requirements
    │   ├─ Is there an official API?
    │   │   ├─ YES → Use the API (recommended)
    │   │   └─ NO → Review legal requirements
    │   │       ├─ Compliant? → Proceed with caution
    │   │       └─ Not sure? → Consult legal counsel
    └─ NO → Use educational examples
```

## 📋 Pre-Implementation Checklist

### For Educational Use ✅

## 🚨 Red Flags - Stop and Reconsider

If any of these apply, reconsider your approach:

- ❌ Website terms of service prohibit automation
- ❌ Content requires user login or authentication

- ❌ Official API is available but you're choosing to scrape
- ❌ Website has technical measures to prevent automation
- ❌ You're uncertain about legal compliance
- ❌ Commercial use without proper licensing

## ✅ Green Lights - Proceed with Confidence

These scenarios are generally safer:

- ✅ Using educational examples for learning
- ✅ Official APIs with proper authentication
- ✅ Public data with clear legal basis
- ✅ Compliance verified by legal counsel
- ✅ Proper rate limiting and respectful automation
- ✅ Clear data retention and deletion policies
- ✅ Transparent data usage and user consent

## 📞 When to Get Help
