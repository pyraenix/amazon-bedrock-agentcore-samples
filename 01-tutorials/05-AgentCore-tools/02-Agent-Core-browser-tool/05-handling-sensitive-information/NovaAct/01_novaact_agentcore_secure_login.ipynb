    "- **What it means**: AgentCore handles all browser infrastructure, updates, and security patches\n",
    "- **NovaAct benefit**: No need to manage browser security or updates locally\n",
    "- **Security impact**: Always running on secure, up-to-date browser infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Automatic Resource Cleanup**\n",
    "- **What it means**: AgentCore automatically cleans up browser sessions and data\n",
    "- **NovaAct benefit**: No risk of sensitive data persisting after automation\n",
    "- **Security impact**: Zero data leakage between sessions\n",
