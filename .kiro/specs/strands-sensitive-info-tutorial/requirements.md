# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a comprehensive tutorial on how Strands agents handle sensitive information when integrated with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool. The tutorial will demonstrate production-ready patterns for secure web automation, credential management, and PII protection using Strands' code-first framework within AgentCore's managed browser environment.

The tutorial follows the established pattern of existing sensitive information handling tutorials (LlamaIndex and NovaAct) but focuses specifically on Strands agents' unique capabilities for secure browser automation. It will provide developers with practical, production-ready examples that can be immediately implemented in enterprise environments.
