# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification addresses critical issues in the Browser Tool with Strands Integration tutorial (03-browser-tool-with-strands) to ensure consistency with other AgentCore tutorials and proper environment setup. The tutorial currently has several configuration and documentation issues that prevent users from successfully following the setup instructions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer following the browser tool tutorial, I want clear Python version requirements so that I can set up the correct environment before starting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user reads the requirements.txt file THEN they SHALL see the minimum Python version specified
2. WHEN a user reads the README THEN the Python version requirement SHALL be consistent between documentation and requirements
3. IF a user has Python < 3.10 THEN they SHALL receive clear guidance on upgrading their environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer working with the tutorial, I want only relevant files included so that I don't encounter workspace-specific configurations that don't apply to my setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user downloads the tutorial THEN they SHALL NOT find IDE-specific workspace files
2. WHEN a user follows the tutorial THEN all referenced files SHALL exist and be necessary for the tutorial
3. IF workspace files are needed for development THEN they SHALL be in a separate development folder or gitignored

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer setting up AWS credentials, I want a proper environment template so that I can configure my credentials correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user needs to set up environment variables THEN they SHALL find a .env.template file
2. WHEN a user reads the setup instructions THEN the .env.template SHALL contain all required environment variables
3. WHEN a user copies the template THEN they SHALL have clear comments explaining each variable

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer following AgentCore tutorials, I want consistent structure and documentation so that I can easily navigate between different tutorials.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user compares this tutorial with others THEN the file structure SHALL be consistent
2. WHEN a user reads the README THEN the format and sections SHALL match other AgentCore tutorials
3. WHEN a user looks for prerequisites THEN they SHALL find them in a standardized format

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer installing dependencies, I want proper version constraints so that I avoid compatibility issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user installs from requirements.txt THEN all packages SHALL have appropriate version constraints
2. WHEN a user encounters version conflicts THEN the requirements SHALL specify compatible versions
3. IF newer versions are available THEN the requirements SHALL use minimum version constraints with compatibility notes
