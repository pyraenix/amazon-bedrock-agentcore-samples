# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a standalone tutorial demonstrating CAPTCHA handling capabilities using LlamaIndex with AWS Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool. 

**Location**: `01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool/04-captcha-handling-tutorials/llamaindex/`

This is Phase 1 (Tutorial Creation) - a comprehensive educational resource that teaches CAPTCHA handling concepts and techniques using LlamaIndex framework integrated with AgentCore Browser Tool.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using LlamaIndex with AgentCore Browser Tool, I want a comprehensive tutorial on CAPTCHA handling, so that I can implement robust automation workflows that can handle CAPTCHA challenges using LlamaIndex's agent patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer opens the tutorial notebook THEN they SHALL see clear explanations of CAPTCHA types and detection methods specific to LlamaIndex integration
2. WHEN the tutorial demonstrates CAPTCHA detection THEN it SHALL show how to identify different CAPTCHA types (image-based, text-based, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha) using LlamaIndex tools
3. WHEN the tutorial shows CAPTCHA solving THEN it SHALL demonstrate integration with AI vision models through LlamaIndex's Bedrock integration
4. WHEN error handling is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL show graceful fallback strategies for unsolvable CAPTCHAs using LlamaIndex's error handling patterns

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want practical code examples for CAPTCHA handling with LlamaIndex, so that I can implement similar functionality in my own LlamaIndex-based projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial provides code examples THEN they SHALL be executable within the notebook environment using LlamaIndex patterns
2. WHEN demonstrating LlamaIndex integration THEN it SHALL show proper tool creation, agent configuration, and workflow orchestration
3. WHEN showing AI model integration THEN it SHALL demonstrate how to use Bedrock vision models through LlamaIndex's model interface
4. WHEN providing examples THEN they SHALL include both successful and failed CAPTCHA scenarios with LlamaIndex error handling

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand best practices for CAPTCHA handling with LlamaIndex, so that I can build ethical and compliant automation solutions using LlamaIndex's enterprise features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial discusses ethics THEN it SHALL include guidelines for responsible CAPTCHA handling in LlamaIndex workflows
2. WHEN rate limiting is covered THEN it SHALL show how to implement delays and retry logic using LlamaIndex's workflow capabilities
3. WHEN security considerations are discussed THEN it SHALL cover session management and credential handling within LlamaIndex's security model
4. WHEN compliance is addressed THEN it SHALL mention terms of service and legal considerations for LlamaIndex-based automation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tutorial to integrate seamlessly with existing LlamaIndex and AgentCore tutorials, so that I can follow a logical learning progression within the LlamaIndex ecosystem.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial is accessed THEN it SHALL reference and build upon previous LlamaIndex and AgentCore Browser Tool tutorials
2. WHEN prerequisites are mentioned THEN they SHALL clearly state required setup from earlier LlamaIndex and AgentCore tutorials
3. WHEN the tutorial is completed THEN it SHALL provide next steps and advanced topics specific to LlamaIndex CAPTCHA integration
4. WHEN integrated with the tutorial series THEN it SHALL maintain consistent formatting and style with other LlamaIndex documentation
