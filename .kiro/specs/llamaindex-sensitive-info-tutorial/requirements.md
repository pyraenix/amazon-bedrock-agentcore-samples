# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This tutorial demonstrates how LlamaIndex agents handle sensitive information when integrated with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool. The tutorial will showcase production-ready patterns for secure data handling, including PII protection, credential management, and secure browser automation workflows. Unlike mock demonstrations, this tutorial will provide real-world integration examples that developers can use in production environments.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using LlamaIndex with AgentCore Browser Tool, I want to understand how to securely handle sensitive information during web automation tasks, so that I can build production-ready applications that protect user data and comply with security best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial is accessed THEN it SHALL provide comprehensive documentation on LlamaIndex integration with AgentCore Browser Tool for sensitive data handling
2. WHEN developers follow the tutorial THEN they SHALL learn how to implement secure credential management patterns
3. WHEN sensitive information is processed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper data isolation and protection mechanisms
4. WHEN web forms contain PII THEN the tutorial SHALL show how to handle this data securely without exposure
5. IF authentication is required THEN the system SHALL demonstrate secure login patterns using AgentCore's containerized environment

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want to see real implementation examples of LlamaIndex agents interacting with sensitive web applications, so that I can understand the security boundaries and isolation mechanisms provided by AgentCore Browser Tool.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial demonstrates web interactions THEN it SHALL use real AgentCore Browser Tool sessions without mock implementations
2. WHEN sensitive data is encountered THEN the system SHALL show proper data masking and protection techniques
3. WHEN browser sessions are created THEN the tutorial SHALL demonstrate the containerized isolation features
4. WHEN data is extracted from web pages THEN it SHALL show secure handling and storage patterns
5. IF credentials are needed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate secure credential injection without exposure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a LlamaIndex developer, I want to learn how to build RAG applications that can securely interact with authenticated web services, so that I can create intelligent agents that work with private, sensitive data sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN building RAG applications THEN the tutorial SHALL demonstrate secure data ingestion from web sources
2. WHEN LlamaIndex queries are executed THEN they SHALL properly handle sensitive context without data leakage
3. WHEN web data is indexed THEN the system SHALL show proper data sanitization and protection
4. WHEN agents interact with authenticated services THEN they SHALL maintain session security throughout the workflow
5. IF sensitive documents are processed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper access controls and data handling

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a production engineer, I want to understand the observability and monitoring capabilities when LlamaIndex agents handle sensitive information through AgentCore Browser Tool, so that I can ensure compliance and detect potential security issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate logging without exposing sensitive data
2. WHEN browser sessions are active THEN the tutorial SHALL show monitoring and debugging capabilities
3. WHEN errors occur during sensitive operations THEN they SHALL be handled securely without data exposure
4. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate proper logging patterns
5. IF compliance reporting is required THEN the tutorial SHALL show how to generate secure audit logs

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer implementing production workflows, I want to see complete end-to-end examples of LlamaIndex agents handling sensitive information workflows, so that I can understand the full integration pattern and best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN complete workflows are demonstrated THEN they SHALL include real authentication, data extraction, and processing steps
2. WHEN multiple sensitive operations are chained THEN the system SHALL maintain security throughout the entire workflow
3. WHEN data flows between LlamaIndex and AgentCore THEN it SHALL demonstrate secure data transfer patterns
4. WHEN sessions need to be managed THEN the tutorial SHALL show proper session lifecycle management
5. IF error recovery is needed THEN the system SHALL demonstrate secure error handling and recovery patterns
