# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating a comprehensive tutorial that demonstrates **how NovaAct handles sensitive information when integrated with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool**. The tutorial will show developers real, working examples of secure browser automation using the actual NovaAct SDK with AgentCore's managed browser infrastructure, focusing on practical patterns for handling credentials, PII, and sensitive form data in production environments.

The tutorial will be positioned as an advanced guide at `01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool/05-handling-sensitive-information/NovaAct/` and will demonstrate the complete integration between NovaAct's natural language browser automation and AgentCore's secure, scalable browser environment.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using NovaAct with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool, I want to understand how NovaAct's natural language automation handles sensitive information within AgentCore's managed browser environment, so that I can build secure, production-ready browser automation solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I access the tutorial THEN I SHALL find executable Jupyter notebooks showing real NovaAct SDK integration with AgentCore browser_session()
2. WHEN I run the examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate actual NovaAct.act() calls handling sensitive data within AgentCore's containerized browser environment
3. WHEN I follow the integration patterns THEN they SHALL show how NovaAct's AI model processes sensitive prompts securely within AgentCore's infrastructure
4. WHEN I implement the examples THEN they SHALL work with real AgentCore CDP endpoints and NovaAct API authentication
5. WHEN I complete the tutorial THEN I SHALL understand how NovaAct's agentic approach protects sensitive data during multi-step web workflows

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer automating forms with sensitive data, I want to see how NovaAct's natural language instructions handle PII, credentials, and payment information within AgentCore's secure browser sessions, so that I can automate sensitive workflows safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN automating login workflows THEN the tutorial SHALL show how NovaAct processes credential-related prompts without exposing them in AgentCore session logs
2. WHEN filling forms with PII THEN the tutorial SHALL demonstrate how NovaAct's AI model handles personal information securely within AgentCore's isolated environment
3. WHEN processing payment forms THEN the tutorial SHALL show NovaAct's secure handling of financial data in AgentCore browser sessions
4. WHEN capturing screenshots THEN the tutorial SHALL demonstrate AgentCore's built-in capabilities for redacting sensitive areas during NovaAct operations
5. WHEN debugging failed automations THEN the tutorial SHALL show how to safely log NovaAct operations without exposing sensitive data from AgentCore sessions

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer learning secure browser automation, I want step-by-step examples showing how NovaAct and AgentCore work together to protect sensitive information, so that I can understand the security benefits of their integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting the tutorial THEN I SHALL find a basic example showing NovaAct connecting to AgentCore's managed browser with secure credential handling
2. WHEN progressing through examples THEN each SHALL build complexity while showing how AgentCore's isolation protects NovaAct operations
3. WHEN learning about data protection THEN the tutorial SHALL show before/after comparisons of insecure vs secure NovaAct-AgentCore patterns
4. WHEN implementing workflows THEN I SHALL have working code that demonstrates NovaAct's natural language processing within AgentCore's secure environment
5. WHEN completing the tutorial THEN I SHALL understand how to leverage both NovaAct's AI capabilities and AgentCore's security features together

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer building production systems, I want to see real integration patterns between NovaAct's SDK and AgentCore's browser infrastructure for handling sensitive operations, so that I can deploy secure automation at scale.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up production integration THEN the tutorial SHALL show actual browser_session() configuration with NovaAct SDK authentication
2. WHEN managing API keys THEN the tutorial SHALL demonstrate secure storage and retrieval for both NovaAct API keys and AgentCore credentials
3. WHEN handling session failures THEN the tutorial SHALL show proper error handling that protects sensitive data in both NovaAct and AgentCore contexts
4. WHEN scaling operations THEN the tutorial SHALL demonstrate how AgentCore's auto-scaling works with NovaAct's concurrent automation sessions
5. WHEN monitoring production THEN the tutorial SHALL show how to use AgentCore's observability features to monitor NovaAct operations securely

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer concerned with compliance and security, I want to understand the security architecture of NovaAct-AgentCore integration and how it protects sensitive information, so that I can meet enterprise security requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN learning about the integration THEN the tutorial SHALL explain how AgentCore's containerized environment isolates NovaAct operations
2. WHEN seeing code examples THEN each SHALL include security annotations explaining how NovaAct and AgentCore protect sensitive data
3. WHEN comparing approaches THEN the tutorial SHALL show the security advantages of using NovaAct with AgentCore vs traditional browser automation
4. WHEN implementing logging THEN the tutorial SHALL demonstrate AgentCore's secure logging capabilities for NovaAct operations
5. WHEN deploying to production THEN the tutorial SHALL provide security guidelines specific to NovaAct-AgentCore integration patterns
