# Browser-use CAPTCHA Integration with AgentCore Browser Tool

## Introduction

This feature will integrate the existing Browser-use CAPTCHA handling tutorial with AgentCore Browser Tool to provide a unified, enterprise-ready solution that combines Browser-use's CAPTCHA expertise with AgentCore's managed browser infrastructure.

**Location**: `01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool/04-captcha-handling-tutorials/browser-use/`

This integration enhances the existing tutorial by adding AgentCore Browser Tool SDK usage while maintaining all existing Browser-use CAPTCHA handling capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AgentCore Browser Tool Integration

**User Story:** As a developer using AgentCore Browser Tool, I want to handle CAPTCHAs using Browser-use capabilities within AgentCore managed sessions, so that I can leverage both Browser-use's CAPTCHA expertise and AgentCore's enterprise features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial is accessed THEN it SHALL demonstrate AgentCore Browser Tool SDK for browser management
2. WHEN CAPTCHA detection is performed THEN it SHALL work with AgentCore managed browser sessions
3. WHEN the integration is used THEN it SHALL maintain all existing CAPTCHA handling capabilities
4. WHEN the tutorial is completed THEN it SHALL demonstrate hybrid architecture benefits

### Requirement 2: Unified SDK Usage

**User Story:** As a developer following AgentCore patterns, I want to use AgentCore's unified SDK methods (interact, parse, discover), so that my CAPTCHA handling integrates seamlessly with other AgentCore tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser operations are performed THEN they SHALL use AgentCore SDK methods where appropriate
2. WHEN CAPTCHA-specific logic is needed THEN it SHALL maintain Browser-use for specialized functionality
3. WHEN the tutorial demonstrates integration THEN it SHALL show AgentCore tool composition patterns
4. WHEN ecosystem features are used THEN it SHALL integrate with AgentCore Memory and Observability

### Requirement 3: Enterprise Security Features

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want CAPTCHA handling to use AgentCore's VM isolation and security features, so that my automation is secure and compliant with enterprise requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser sessions are created THEN they SHALL use AgentCore managed browser sessions
2. WHEN the tutorial demonstrates security THEN it SHALL show VM isolation benefits
3. WHEN enterprise features are shown THEN it SHALL demonstrate security configuration
4. WHEN compatibility is tested THEN it SHALL maintain existing CAPTCHA detection accuracy

### Requirement 4: Ecosystem Integration

**User Story:** As a developer building comprehensive automation, I want CAPTCHA handling to integrate with AgentCore Memory and Observability, so that I can build stateful, monitored automation workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CAPTCHA patterns are detected THEN they SHALL be stored in AgentCore Memory
2. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN it SHALL use AgentCore Observability for metrics
3. WHEN cross-tool integration is demonstrated THEN it SHALL show data sharing patterns
4. WHEN workflow orchestration is shown THEN it SHALL demonstrate AgentCore ecosystem benefits

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user of the existing tutorial, I want the integration to maintain existing functionality, so that my current CAPTCHA handling code continues to work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing CAPTCHA detection is tested THEN all types SHALL still be supported (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, image, text)
2. WHEN the existing test suite is run THEN it SHALL continue to pass
3. WHEN documentation is updated THEN it SHALL reflect the integration changes
4. WHEN migration is needed THEN a clear path SHALL be provided for existing implementations

## Technical Requirements

### TR-1: AgentCore Browser Tool SDK Integration
- Import and use `bedrock_agentcore.browser.AgentCoreBrowser`
- Replace direct browser-use Browser instantiation with AgentCore managed sessions where appropriate
- Maintain Browser-use for CAPTCHA-specific detection and solving logic
- Demonstrate hybrid architecture in notebook cells

### TR-2: Hybrid Architecture Implementation
- Create integration layer between Browser-use and AgentCore (already exists in `agentcore_captcha_integration.py`)
- Preserve Browser-use's CAPTCHA detection algorithms
- Use AgentCore for browser lifecycle management
- Show both approaches in tutorial examples

### TR-3: Dependencies Update
- Ensure `bedrock-agentcore>=1.0.0` is in requirements.txt (already done)
- Update import statements in notebook cells
- Maintain existing Browser-use dependencies
- Test compatibility between frameworks

### TR-4: Notebook Integration
- Replace existing Browser-use examples with AgentCore integration examples
- Demonstrate AgentCore Browser Tool as the primary approach
- Show Browser-use CAPTCHA logic working within AgentCore managed sessions
- Add AgentCore ecosystem integration examples (Memory, Observability)

### TR-5: Documentation Updates
- Update README.md to reflect AgentCore integration
- Modify troubleshooting guide for AgentCore-specific issues
- Update testing documentation for integration scenarios
- Add architecture diagrams showing hybrid approach

## Success Metrics
- [ ] Tutorial successfully demonstrates AgentCore Browser Tool + Browser-use integration
- [ ] All existing CAPTCHA types (reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, image, text) work with integration
- [ ] Notebook cells execute without errors using AgentCore integration
- [ ] Documentation clearly explains hybrid architecture benefits
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show comparable or improved results

## Out of Scope
- Creating new CAPTCHA detection algorithms
- Modifying Browser-use core functionality
- Implementing new AgentCore Browser Tool features
- Supporting non-AWS cloud providers
- Replacing all Browser-use usage (hybrid approach is preferred)

## Dependencies
- AgentCore Browser Tool SDK availability
- Browser-use framework compatibility with AgentCore
- AWS Bedrock service access
- Existing tutorial infrastructure and test suite

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Risk**: AgentCore SDK API changes breaking integration
  **Mitigation**: Use stable SDK versions and version pinning
- **Risk**: Browser-use compatibility issues with AgentCore managed sessions
  **Mitigation**: Thorough testing and fallback mechanisms
- **Risk**: Performance degradation from additional abstraction layers
  **Mitigation**: Performance benchmarking and optimization
- **Risk**: Complexity increase making tutorial harder to follow
  **Mitigation**: Focus on AgentCore integration as primary approach, use Browser-use as underlying CAPTCHA logic

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All user stories implemented and tested
- [ ] Technical requirements satisfied
- [ ] Notebook cells demonstrate integration
- [ ] Documentation updated and reviewed
- [ ] Test suite passing for both approaches
- [ ] Performance benchmarks acceptable
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Integration validated end-to-end
