# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a production-ready Browser-use framework integration for CAPTCHA handling with AWS Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool, providing a complete enterprise-grade solution that combines Browser-use's CAPTCHA expertise with AgentCore's managed browser infrastructure.

**Location**: `03-integrations/bedrock-agentcore-browser-tool/agentic-frameworks/captcha-handling/browser-use/`

This is a production integration that creates a complete Browser-use + AgentCore Browser Tool framework integration with enterprise features, production tools, examples, and comprehensive documentation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AgentCore Browser Tool Integration

**User Story:** As a production developer, I want to use AgentCore Browser Tool for managed browser sessions while leveraging Browser-use's CAPTCHA detection capabilities, so that I can build enterprise-grade CAPTCHA handling solutions with VM isolation and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browser sessions are created THEN they SHALL use AgentCore Browser Tool SDK for managed sessions
2. WHEN CAPTCHA detection is performed THEN it SHALL use Browser-use algorithms within AgentCore managed browsers
3. WHEN the integration is deployed THEN it SHALL provide VM isolation and enterprise security features
4. WHEN browser lifecycle is managed THEN it SHALL use AgentCore session management with proper cleanup

### Requirement 2: AgentCore Ecosystem Integration

**User Story:** As an enterprise developer, I want CAPTCHA handling to integrate with the full AgentCore ecosystem (Memory, Observability, Runtime), so that I can build comprehensive, monitored, and stateful automation solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CAPTCHA patterns are detected THEN they SHALL be stored in AgentCore Memory for pattern recognition
2. WHEN CAPTCHA operations are performed THEN they SHALL be tracked via AgentCore Observability with metrics and monitoring
3. WHEN the integration is used THEN it SHALL leverage AgentCore Runtime for orchestration and workflow management
4. WHEN cross-tool integration is needed THEN it SHALL demonstrate seamless data sharing across AgentCore tools

### Requirement 3: Production-Ready CAPTCHA Detection and Solving

**User Story:** As a production developer, I want comprehensive CAPTCHA detection and AI-powered solving capabilities that work reliably at scale, so that I can handle all major CAPTCHA types in enterprise environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CAPTCHAs are encountered THEN the system SHALL detect reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha, image-based, and text-based CAPTCHAs with high accuracy
2. WHEN CAPTCHA solving is needed THEN it SHALL use AWS Bedrock models via AgentCore for intelligent analysis
3. WHEN production workloads are processed THEN it SHALL handle concurrent CAPTCHA requests with proper resource management
4. WHEN error scenarios occur THEN it SHALL provide robust error handling, retry logic, and fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 4: Enterprise Features and Deployment

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want production-ready deployment artifacts, monitoring, and enterprise features, so that I can deploy and maintain CAPTCHA handling solutions in enterprise environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the integration THEN it SHALL provide Docker containers, CI/CD configurations, and deployment guides
2. WHEN monitoring is needed THEN it SHALL integrate with AgentCore Observability for comprehensive metrics and alerting
3. WHEN security is required THEN it SHALL provide enterprise security features, audit logging, and compliance capabilities
4. WHEN scaling is needed THEN it SHALL support horizontal scaling, load balancing, and resource optimization

### Requirement 5: Browser-use Framework Compatibility

**User Story:** As a Browser-use developer, I want the integration to maintain full compatibility with Browser-use patterns and workflows, so that I can leverage existing Browser-use knowledge and code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using Browser-use patterns THEN they SHALL work seamlessly within AgentCore managed sessions
2. WHEN Browser-use workflows are executed THEN they SHALL automatically handle CAPTCHAs without breaking existing logic
3. WHEN Browser-use actions are performed THEN they SHALL benefit from AgentCore's enterprise features
4. WHEN migrating existing Browser-use code THEN it SHALL require minimal changes to work with AgentCore integration
