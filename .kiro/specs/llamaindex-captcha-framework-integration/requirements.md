# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a production-ready LlamaIndex framework integration for CAPTCHA handling with AWS Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool.

**Location**: `03-integrations/bedrock-agentcore-browser-tool/agentic-frameworks/captcha-handling/llamaindex/`

This is Phase 2 (Integration) - creating a complete LlamaIndex framework integration with tools, examples, and documentation for production use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a LlamaIndex developer, I want a native framework integration for CAPTCHA handling, so that I can use CAPTCHA capabilities as standard LlamaIndex tools in my agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using the integration THEN it SHALL provide LlamaIndex-native tool classes for CAPTCHA handling
2. WHEN integrating with agents THEN it SHALL follow LlamaIndex's standard tool and agent patterns
3. WHEN handling responses THEN it SHALL use LlamaIndex's response schemas and data structures
4. WHEN configuring CAPTCHA tools THEN they SHALL integrate with LlamaIndex's configuration system

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a LlamaIndex developer, I want the CAPTCHA integration to be discoverable and well-documented within the LlamaIndex framework structure, so that I can easily find and implement it.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN browsing LlamaIndex integrations THEN developers SHALL find the CAPTCHA integration in the expected location
2. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN it SHALL follow LlamaIndex documentation standards
3. WHEN looking for examples THEN they SHALL find working LlamaIndex agent implementations
4. WHEN seeking support THEN they SHALL have access to LlamaIndex-specific troubleshooting guides

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a LlamaIndex developer, I want the CAPTCHA integration to be production-ready with proper testing and error handling, so that I can use it in real applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to production THEN the integration SHALL include comprehensive error handling
2. WHEN testing the integration THEN it SHALL have unit tests following LlamaIndex testing patterns
3. WHEN handling failures THEN it SHALL provide graceful degradation and retry mechanisms
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN it SHALL integrate with LlamaIndex's observability features

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer of LlamaIndex integrations, I want the CAPTCHA integration to follow established patterns and be maintainable, so that it can be properly supported and updated.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code structure THEN it SHALL follow LlamaIndex integration patterns
2. WHEN updating dependencies THEN it SHALL be compatible with LlamaIndex version requirements
3. WHEN making changes THEN it SHALL have clear contribution guidelines
4. WHEN releasing updates THEN it SHALL follow LlamaIndex's release and versioning practices
