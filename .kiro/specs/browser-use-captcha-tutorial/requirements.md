# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a standalone tutorial demonstrating CAPTCHA handling capabilities using Browser-use with AWS Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool. 

**Location**: `01-tutorials/05-AgentCore-tools/02-Agent-Core-browser-tool/04-captcha-handling-tutorials/browser-use-captcha.ipynb`

This is Phase 1 (Tutorial Creation) - a comprehensive educational resource that teaches CAPTCHA handling concepts and techniques.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Browser-use with AgentCore Browser Tool, I want a comprehensive tutorial on CAPTCHA handling, so that I can implement robust automation workflows that can handle CAPTCHA challenges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a developer opens the tutorial notebook THEN they SHALL see clear explanations of CAPTCHA types and detection methods
2. WHEN the tutorial demonstrates CAPTCHA detection THEN it SHALL show how to identify different CAPTCHA types (image-based, text-based, reCAPTCHA, hCaptcha)
3. WHEN the tutorial shows CAPTCHA solving THEN it SHALL demonstrate integration with AI vision models for image analysis
4. WHEN error handling is demonstrated THEN the system SHALL show graceful fallback strategies for unsolvable CAPTCHAs

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want practical code examples for CAPTCHA handling, so that I can implement similar functionality in my own projects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial provides code examples THEN they SHALL be executable within the notebook environment
2. WHEN demonstrating Browser-use integration THEN it SHALL show proper session management and error handling
3. WHEN showing AI model integration THEN it SHALL demonstrate how to use Bedrock vision models for CAPTCHA analysis
4. WHEN providing examples THEN they SHALL include both successful and failed CAPTCHA scenarios

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to understand best practices for CAPTCHA handling, so that I can build ethical and compliant automation solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial discusses ethics THEN it SHALL include guidelines for responsible CAPTCHA handling
2. WHEN rate limiting is covered THEN it SHALL show how to implement delays and retry logic
3. WHEN security considerations are discussed THEN it SHALL cover session management and credential handling
4. WHEN compliance is addressed THEN it SHALL mention terms of service and legal considerations

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the tutorial to integrate seamlessly with existing Browser-use tutorials, so that I can follow a logical learning progression.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the tutorial is accessed THEN it SHALL reference and build upon previous Browser-use tutorials
2. WHEN prerequisites are mentioned THEN they SHALL clearly state required setup from earlier tutorials
3. WHEN the tutorial is completed THEN it SHALL provide next steps and advanced topics
4. WHEN integrated with the tutorial series THEN it SHALL maintain consistent formatting and style
