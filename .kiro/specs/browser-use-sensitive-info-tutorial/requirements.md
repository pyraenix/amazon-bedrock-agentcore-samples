# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will create a comprehensive tutorial demonstrating how browser-use integrates with Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser Tool to securely handle sensitive information during web automation tasks. The tutorial will showcase the unique capabilities of the AgentCore Browser Tool's enterprise-grade security features, including micro-VM isolation, session management, and observability, while demonstrating how browser-use leverages these features for sensitive data scenarios. The tutorial will be similar in structure to the existing NovaAct tutorial but focused specifically on the browser-use + AgentCore Browser Tool integration for secure handling of sensitive data in real-world enterprise scenarios.
