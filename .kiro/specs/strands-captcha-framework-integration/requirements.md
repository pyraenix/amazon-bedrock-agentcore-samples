# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature will extend the existing Strands browser tool integration to include production-ready CAPTCHA handling capabilities.

**Location**: `03-integrations/bedrock-agentcore-browser-tool/agentic-frameworks/captcha-handling/strands-agents/`

This is Phase 2 (Integration) - extending the current Strands integration with CAPTCHA handling tools, examples, and documentation for production use.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Strands developer using the existing browser tool integration, I want CAPTCHA handling to be seamlessly added to the current integration, so that I can handle CAPTCHAs without changing my existing agent implementations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN adding CAPTCHA capabilities THEN they SHALL extend the existing Strands browser tool without breaking changes
2. WHEN using CAPTCHA features THEN they SHALL follow the established Strands tool interface patterns
3. WHEN integrating with existing agents THEN CAPTCHA handling SHALL work with current Strands workflows
4. WHEN upgrading the integration THEN existing Strands browser tool functionality SHALL remain unchanged

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Strands developer, I want CAPTCHA handling to maintain the same architecture and security standards as the existing integration, so that I can trust it for production use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN handling CAPTCHAs THEN the system SHALL maintain the existing security isolation model
2. WHEN processing CAPTCHA responses THEN they SHALL use the established Strands response handling patterns
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL integrate with the existing Strands error handling and recovery mechanisms
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN CAPTCHA metrics SHALL integrate with existing Strands observability

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Strands developer, I want comprehensive documentation that shows how CAPTCHA handling fits into the existing Strands architecture, so that I can implement and customize it effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing documentation THEN it SHALL show how CAPTCHA handling extends the existing architecture
2. WHEN following examples THEN they SHALL demonstrate integration with existing Strands browser tool patterns
3. WHEN customizing behavior THEN developers SHALL have access to configuration options that align with Strands conventions
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN they SHALL find debugging guides specific to the Strands CAPTCHA integration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the Strands integration, I want CAPTCHA handling to be properly integrated into the existing codebase structure, so that it's maintainable and follows established patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the code structure THEN CAPTCHA handling SHALL follow the existing Strands integration organization
2. WHEN updating the integration THEN CAPTCHA features SHALL be versioned with the main Strands integration
3. WHEN making changes THEN they SHALL follow the established Strands integration development patterns
4. WHEN documenting updates THEN they SHALL be included in the main Strands integration documentation
